# File format specifications

This is where new tertiary file format specifications will be proposed. We aim to follow as structured a process as is feasible, following conventions from previous efforts by e.g. GA4GH (see https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs). 

We aim to seek the agreement of relevant communities and tool developers as specs are created, modified and mature, but seek to proceed in a structured manner such that tool builders can rely on format conventions.
